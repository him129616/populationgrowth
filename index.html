            <h1>Introduction</h1>
            <p>Population growth is one of the most important topics we cover at Our World in Data.

                For most of human history, the global population was a tiny fraction of what it is today. Over the last
                few
                centuries, the human population has gone through an extraordinary change. In 1800, there were one
                billion
                people. Today there are more than 8 billion of us.

                But after a period of very fast population growth, demographers expect the world population to peak by
                the
                end of this century.

                On this page, you will find all of our data, charts, and writing on changes in population growth. This
                includes how populations are distributed worldwide, how this has changed, and what demographers expect
                for
                the future.</p>

            <h1>WORLD POPULATION:</h1>
            <p class="card-text"> The world population has changed in dramatic ways over the last few centuries. Let’s
                take a look at long-run data on population to understand this change, and how quickly the world
                population is growing today.

                The chart shows the increasing number of people living on our planet over the last 12,000 years. A
                mind-boggling change: the world population today is around 2,000 times the size of what it was 12,000
                ago when the world population was around 4 million – less than half of the current population of London.

                What is striking about this chart is of course that almost all of this growth happened just very
                recently. Historical demographers estimate that around the year 1800 the world population was only
                around 1 billion people. This implies that on average the population grew very slowly over this long
                time from 10,000 BCE to 1700 (by 0.04% annually). After 1800 this changed fundamentally: the world
                population was around 1 billion in the year 1800 and is now, at around 8 billion, 8 times larger.

                Around 108 billion people have ever lived on our planet. This means that today’s population size makes
                up 6.5% of the total number of people ever born.1

                For the long period from the appearance of modern Homo sapiens up to the starting point of this chart in
                10,000 BCE it is estimated that the total world population was often well under one million.2 In this
                period our species was often seriously threatened by extinction.</p>

        <h1>ECONOMY:</h1>
        <h3>Population has various impacts<br> <br> Some important impacts are discussed below: </h3>

        <p class="card-text">
        <h3>1. Population Growth and Income Growth:</h3>
        <p class="text1"> During 1950-51 and 1999-00, India’s national in­come (at 1993-94 prices) increased by 4.4% per
            annum. But population increased at the rate of 2.2%. The net result has been modest 2.1% in­crease in per
            capita income.

            Thus, in spite of plan­ning, India has failed to achieve a satisfactory growth rate. In fact, rapid growth
            of population has acted as the main obstacle to India’s material progress during the entire plan period.
            What is surprising is that no really effective measure has been adopted to slow down the rate of growth of
            population. <br></p>
        <h3> 2. Population and Food Problem:</h3>

        Consequently the food problem that the country faced in the 1950s and 1960s has become a thing of the past. But,
        food problem is likely to arise again mainly due to rapid growth of population. At present due to satisfactory
        food stock the Gov­ernment occasionally imports food-grains, in order to maintain a buffer stock. If country is
        to reach self-sufficiency in food-grains, population growth has to be checked.

        Moreover, due to population growth, per capita net availability of food-grains per day has to fall in India. No
        doubt the per capita availabil­ity of food-grains per day increased from 431 grams in 1956 to 469 grams in 1961.
        It remained un­changed at that level in 1971. But it fell subse­quently to 435.8 grams in 1981.


        It again increased slightly because of bumper crops in some of the years. It was 510.1 grams per day in 1991.
        But it fell to 476.2 grams in 1996. It again increased marginally in 505.5 grams per day in 19.97. It again fell
        to 466 grams in 2000. Thus, the marginal in­crease in per capita availability of food-grains in some of the
        years and drop in other years is mainly due to population growth.

        Moreover, due to unchecked growth of popu­lation in rural areas, total demand for food is in­creasing. But, at
        the same time, per capita food consumption is falling. So, the quantum of mar­ketable surplus is declining in
        spite of satisfac­tory crop in most of the years in the recent past. <br>
        <br> Thus, in the face of rising population, a fall in per capita food consumption cannot raise the genera­tion
        of marketable surplus. Indian planners and policymakers must take note of this reality and adopt some harsh
        measures to reduce the size of family, especially in rural areas.
        <h3>3. Population and the Dependency Burden:</h3>
        Due to population, per capita availability of capi­tal falls. This reduces labour absorption and wages remain
        low. Population creates three problems— capital shallowing, age dependency and invest­ment diversion. In
        developing countries like In­dia the percentage of people under the age of 15 is quite high—almost half of the
        total population. A high dependency burden implies a high propor­tion of unproductive consumers.

        These people do not make any contribution to society’s output but consumes a major portion of it. They not only
        cre­ate the problem of disguised unemployment but reduce the rate of saving and capital formation so essential
        for the growth process. There is diver­sion of investment into unproductive consump­tion.

        <h3>4. Population and Unemployment:</h3>
        Popu­lation growth obviously implies an increase in the size of the labour force. In a country where most people
        depend on agriculture, the scope for addi­tional employment creation in the agriculture sec­tor is limited. In
        fact, rapid growth of population and inelasticity of supply of land have created the problem of disguised
        unemployment.

        The lack of industrial employment—because purchasing power is low—makes for high unem­ployment rates as well as
        political unrest. The political unrest, in turn, inhibits economic devel­opment by increasing risks associated
        with capi­tal investment.

        In fact, the number of applications on live register of employment exchanges increased from 3 lakhs in 1950-51
        to 178 lakhs in 1980-81 and 412 million in 2000-01. Thus, despite planning and various industrialisation
        programs, the number of unemployed is on the rise in India’s growing unemployment. The root cause of this is
        rapid population growth.


        <h3>5. Population and the Burden on Social Services:</h3>
        Due to population growth the housing problem has become acute, particularly in urban areas. Moreover, there is
        tremendous demand for land for construction purposes. It has been esti­mated that shortage of housing is 23.1
        million units. Consequently, people are forced to live in congested areas resulting in various health haz­ards.
        The health problem, on the other hand, dam­ages efficiency of labour. <br>

        Moreover, with population growth, the de­mand for medical care is bound to increase. So the government has to
        spend a huge amount of money for setting up hospitals, medical colleges (to train up the required number of
        doctors), clin­ics, and so on. Yet, there is shortage of such fa­cilities in LDCs like India because of the fact
        that demand for medical care (due to population growth and growing urbanisation) increases faster than its
        supply. <br>

        <h1>GLOBAL CHALLENES:</h1>
        <p>The increase in the global population presents a multitude of challenges that affect various aspects of our
            world, including social, economic, environmental, and political dimensions. Here's a detailed overview of
            the global challenges arising from population growth: <br>

        <h3> 1.Resource Scarcity:</h3> <br>
        As the global population continues to rise, the demand for finite resources like freshwater, arable land,
        energy, and minerals increases. This leads to resource scarcity and intensifies competition for these
        essentials. The depletion of natural resources can result in conflicts, resource-driven migration, and higher
        prices for essential goods. <br>

        <h3>2.Environmental Degradation:</h3> <br>
        Rapid population growth contributes to environmental degradation. More people mean increased energy consumption,
        deforestation, pollution, and habitat destruction. This leads to issues such as climate change, loss of
        biodiversity, and the deterioration of ecosystems, with far-reaching consequences for the planet. <br>

        <h3>3.Food Security:</h3> <br>
        Feeding a growing global population is a significant challenge. Increased demand for food can lead to
        overexploitation of agricultural land and water resources, deforestation, and monoculture farming practices.
        These issues not only threaten food security but also harm the environment. <br>

        <h3>4.Urbanization and Infrastructure:</h3> <br>
        The rising population drives urbanization, which poses several challenges. Urban areas need to develop
        infrastructure like housing, transportation, healthcare, and education to accommodate the influx of people.
        Inadequate planning can result in slums, congestion, and substandard living conditions. <br>

        <h3>5.Healthcare:</h3> <br>
        A larger population places greater demands on healthcare systems. Access to quality healthcare becomes a
        concern, as overcrowded hospitals and healthcare facilities can lead to reduced quality of care and increased
        disease transmission. Furthermore, public health measures, like vaccination campaigns, need to be scaled up to
        meet the growing demand. <br>

        <h3>6.Education:</h3> <br>
        The increase in the number of children and youth puts pressure on education systems. Governments must invest in
        schools, teachers, and resources to ensure that all children have access to quality education. Failing to do so
        can result in a less educated workforce and hinder economic development. <br>

        <h3>7.Employment and Economic Challenges:</h3> <br>
        A growing population means a larger labor force. While this can drive economic growth, it can also lead to
        unemployment and underemployment if job opportunities do not keep pace with the population increase.
        Additionally, higher demand for goods and services can drive inflation. <br>

        <h3>8.Migration and Displacement:</h3> <br>
        In regions with rapid population growth, limited opportunities and resources may lead to internal and
        international migration. This can result in challenges related to refugee crises, strained host countries, and
        the potential for conflicts over resources and territory. <br>

        <h3>9.Social and Cultural Challenges: </h3><br>
        Rapid population growth can strain social services and disrupt cultural norms and values. It may also lead to
        generational conflicts, particularly in regions with a youthful population. Family dynamics can change,
        impacting roles and responsibilities within households. <br>

        <h3>10.Political and Governance Challenges: </h3><br>
        Managing a growing population requires effective governance and policies. Governments must address issues
        related to resource allocation, urban planning, healthcare, education, and social services. Failure to do so can
        lead to political instability and social unrest. <br>

        <h3>11.Global Inequality:</h3> <br>
        Population growth is not uniform across the world. Some regions experience high population growth, while others
        face declining populations. This imbalance can exacerbate global inequalities in terms of access to resources,
        economic opportunities, and political power. <br>

        Addressing these global challenges necessitates a combination of sustainable development, responsible resource
        management, family planning initiatives, and international cooperation. Finding solutions to these challenges is
        crucial for ensuring a better future for the planet and its inhabitants while balancing the needs of the growing
        global population with the limitations of our planet's resources.
